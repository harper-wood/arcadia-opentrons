## Context

We have two [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2/?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Branded&utm_term=opentrons%20ot%202&utm_medium=cpc&hsa_tgt=kwd-549863988937&hsa_cam=881433800&hsa_acc=2303351826&hsa_kw=opentrons%20ot%202&hsa_mt=e&hsa_src=g&hsa_grp=55045114298&hsa_ad=305456799804&hsa_ver=3&hsa_net=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkr7GDKkYxWL16_0clCUDiSApJtCua_kb-KFSfV8YSiaMSNLJRof_vYaAtOzEALw_wcB) liquid handling robots.  These may be useful for various lab tasks such as: pouring 96 well solid media plates, distributing and pooling liquid cultures, high-throughput sequencing library preparation, high-throughput protein purification etcâ€¦  The OT-2 is very flexible with both a low-ish level [python API](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/) as well as a graphical programming interface called the â€˜Protocol Designerâ€™; both are available [here](https://opentrons.com/protocols/).  There is also a [very large code base](https://protocols.opentrons.com/) with many developed protocols. A set of getting started tutorials is available [here](https://support.opentrons.com/s/ot2-get-started).

## Downloading and installing the opentrons app

To use the opentrons robot you will need to download and install the opentrons app.  This is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux and is available [here](https://opentrons.com/ot-app/).  After downloading you will need to follow the OS specific installation instructions available [here](https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Get-started-Download-and-install-the-Opentrons-App).  

## Installing the opentrons python API

- If you havenâ€™t already, install python3.  A tutorial for this is available [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).
- If you havenâ€™t already, install pip.  A tutorial for this is available [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
- Open a command line and type: â€˜pip3 install opentronsâ€™

## Accessing our OT-2 robots

- Connect to the Arcadia wifi or wired network.
- Run the opentrons app.
- Select â€˜Devicesâ€™ from the left panel, you should now find both robots.
